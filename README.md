## What I Learned

Building this project with Bootstrap 5 was an eye-opening experience:

- **Bootstrap 5 Centering**: Learned how to center elements in Bootstrap 5, which works quite differently from Bootstrap 4. This was challenging at first but helped me understand the framework's utility-first approach
- **Responsive Design with Bootstrap**: My "aha" moment was figuring out how to properly display the website on smaller screens that aren't desktop-sized. Bootstrap's responsive breakpoints and grid system made this much easier than writing custom media queries
- **Bootstrap Grid System**: Gained a deep understanding of Bootstrap's 12-column grid system and how to use it effectively
- **Bootstrap Components**: Learned how to implement and customize various Bootstrap components like navigation bars, cards, and buttons
- **Utility Classes**: Discovered the power of Bootstrap's utility classes for spacing, alignment, and display properties

## Getting Started

Since this is a static HTML/CSS project using Bootstrap 5, you can simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view it locally. Make sure Bootstrap 5 is properly linked (via CDN or local files).

## Future Improvements

- Add more interactive JavaScript functionality
- Customize Bootstrap components further
- Add more pages and content
- Enhance the design with custom CSS
- Implement additional Bootstrap components
